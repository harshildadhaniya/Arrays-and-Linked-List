# Arrays and Linked List

After learning the basics of the Linked lists and arrays, let us move forward to conversions between lists and arrays.

This repo first creates a copy of linked list such that modifying the copy does not change the original linked list.

Following this, we write functions that will convert a linked list to an array.

Finally, we convert an array back to a linked list.

This repo gives insight on two very important data structures and how they are related to each other. Both of them have their own advantages and disadvantages and it quite useful to use them in their own respective ways.
